# ChatSphere
ChatSphere is designed to facilitate real-time communication between multiple clients while ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. To achieve secure transmission, the system integrates end-to-end encryption using RSA for key exchange and AES-256 for message encryption, preventing unauthorized access and interception. The server efficiently handles multiple concurrent client connections using threading, ensuring seamless communication. A user-friendly GUI (Tkinter) with customizable themes enhances accessibility while robust error handling ensures smooth operation.
